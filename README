NAME
    Geo::IPfree - Look up country of IP Address. This module make this
    off-line and the DB of IPs is free & small.

SYNOPSIS
        use Geo::IPfree;
        my ($country,$country_name) = Geo::IPfree::LookUp("192.168.0.1");

        ... or ...

        use Geo::IPfree qw(LookUp);
        my ($country,$country_name) = LookUp("200.176.3.142");

        ... or ...

        use Geo::IPfree;
        my $GeoIP = Geo::IPfree->new('/GeoIPfree/ipscountry.dat');
        $GeoIP->Faster; ## Enable the faster option.
        my ($country,$country_name,$ip) = $GeoIP->LookUp("www.cnn.com"); ## Getting by Hostname.

        $GeoIP->LoadDB('/GeoIPfree/ips.dat');

        my ($country,$country_name,$ip) = $GeoIP->LookUp("www.sf.net"); ## Getting by Hostname.

        ... or ...

        use Geo::IPfree;  
        my $GeoIP = Geo::IPfree->new(); ## Using the default DB!
        my ($country,$country_name) = $GeoIP->LookUp("64.236.24.28");

DESCRIPTION
    This package comes with it's own database to look up the IP's country,
    and is totally free.

METHODS
  LoadDB
    Load the database to use to LookUp the IPs.

  LookUp
    Returns the ISO 3166 country (XX) code for an IP address or Hostname.

    **If you send a Hostname you will need to be connected to the internet
    to resolve the host IP.

  Clean_Cache
    Clean the memory used by the cache.

  Faster
    Make the LookUp() faster, good for big amount of LookUp()s. This will
    load all the DB in the memory (639Kb) and read from there, not from HD
    (good way for slow HD or network disks), but use more memory. The module
    "Memoize" will be enabled for some internal functions too.

    Note that if you make a big amount of querys to LookUp(), in the end the
    amount of memory can be big, than is better to use more memory from the
    begin and make all faster.

VARS
    $GeoIP->{db}
        The database file in use.

    $GeoIP->{handler}
        The database file handler.

    $GeoIP->{dbfile}
        The database file path.

    $GeoIP->{cache} BOOLEAN
        Set/tell if the cache of LookUp() is on. If it's on it will cache
        the last 1000 querys. Default: 1

        The cache is good when you are parsing a list of IPs, generally a
        web log. If in the log you have many lines with the same IP,
        GEO::IPfree don't need to make a full search for each query, it will
        cache the last 1000 different IPs. After each 1000 IPs the cache is
        cleaned to restart it.

        Note that the Lookup make the query without the last IP number
        (xxx.xxx.xxx.0), then the cache for the IP 192.168.0.1 will be the
        same for 192.168.0.2 (they are the same query, 192.168.0.0).

DB FORMAT
    the DB has a list of IP ranges & countrys, for example, from 200.128.0.0
    to 200.103.255.255 the IPs are from BR. To make a fast access to the DB
    the format try to use less bytes per input (block). The file was in
    ASCII and in blocks of 7 bytes: XXnnnnn

      XX    -> the country code (BR,US...)
      nnnnn -> the IP range using a base of 85 digits
               (not in dec or hex to get space).

    See CPAN for updates of the DB...

NOTES
    The file ipscountry.dat is made only for Geo::IPfree and has their own
    format. To convert it see the tool "ipct2txt.pl" in the "misc" directoy.

    The module looks for "ipscountry.dat" in the following locations:

    *   /usr/local/share

    *   /usr/local/share/GeoIPfree

    *   through @INC (as well as all @INC directories plus "/Geo")

    *   from the same location that IPfree.pm was loaded

    OS and fixed bugs for them, like the not portable sysread, and asked for
    some speed improvement.
